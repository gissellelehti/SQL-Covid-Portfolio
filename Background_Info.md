# SQL-Covid-Portfolio

In this dataset within the time period of January 8, 2020 - May 1, 2021  from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, I used two tables; COVIDDeaths and COVIDVaccinations for analysis. It also includes a Dashboard created on Tableau.

Here's a summary of the main aspects covered:

1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Comparing the total number of COVID-19 cases to the total number of deaths.
2. Likelihood of dying of COVID in Finland: Examining the probability of dying from COVID-19 in Finland.
3. Total Cases vs Population: Analyzing the percentage of the population in Finland that has contracted COVID-19.
4. Countries with Highest Infection rate vs Population: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
5. Countries with Highest death count per Population: Identifying countries with the highest death count in relation to their population.
6. Continents and Regional Associations with Highest death count per Population: Identifying continents and regional associations with the highest death count in relation to their population.
7. Global Numbers: Providing global statistics such as daily cases, deaths, and death percentages related to COVID-19.
8. Joining COVID deaths and vaccination tables: Combining data from COVID-19 deaths and vaccination tables.
9. Total Population vs Vaccinations: Comparing the total population to the number of vaccinations administered.
10. Total Population vs Vaccinations with Rolling Sum of Vaccinations per Country: Analyzing the total population against the rolling sum of vaccinations per country.
11. Utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTE): Using CTEs to simplify complex queries and create temporary tables.
12. Creating views to store data for future visualizations: Constructing views to store specific data subsets for visualization purposes.

The aim was to gain insights into infection rates, death counts, vaccination progress, and population comparisons. The code utilizes CTEs and views to organize and manipulate the data efficiently.
